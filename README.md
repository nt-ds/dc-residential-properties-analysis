# dc-residential-properties-analysis

We have done an analysis with linear regression, logisitic regression, and seasonal decomposition.

We have done some model selection and feature engineering on the linear and logistic models.

We have verified that the seasonal decomposition tracks the expected changes in the market (seasonal and trend).
